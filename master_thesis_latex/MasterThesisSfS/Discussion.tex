\section{Limitations and Future Work}


    Highest posterior density interval (HDI) (https://easystats.github.io/bayestestR/reference/hdi.html)
    Equal-tailed interval (ETI) (https://easystats.github.io/bayestestR/reference/eti.html)


Investigate computational complexity

\begin{itemize}
    \item Use other methods than GPs to simulate BP time series
    \item Investigate the impact of misspecified kernel functions and the effect of adding npn-gaussian errors.
    \item Simulate evolving seasonal component by multiply the periodic kernel with e.g. an RBF kernel
    \item Since measurement error, the periodic and AR component are largely unknown,
    investigate the impact of varying the relative contributions of the different kernels.
    \item Use highest posterior density credible interval (HDI) instead of the equal-tailed interval.
    \item Define day and night BP values with the aid of the predicted cyclic component
    \item Investigate computational complexity of GP and baseline methods

\end{itemize}
