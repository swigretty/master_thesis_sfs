\begin{figure}[hbt!]%--- Picture 'H'ere, 'B'ottom or 'T'op; '!' Try to
                    %impose your will to LaTeX

  kernel]%<<-- Legend for the list of figures at the beginning of you thesis
  {Old Faithful Geyser eruption lengths, $n=272$; binned data and two
    (Gaussian) kernel density estimates ($\times 10$) with $h=h^*= .3348$
    and $h= .1$ (dotted).}% legend displayed below the graph.

Or also with \texttt{includegraphics}:
\begin{figure}[hbt!]%--- Picture 'H'ere, 'B'ottom or 'T'op; '!' Try to
                    %impose your will to LaTeX
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.5\textwidth]{geys-2kern} %<< no file extension
  %%         --- .5\textwidth stands for 50% of text width
  \caption[Geyser data: binned histogram, Silverman's and another
  kernel]%<<-- Legend for the list of figures at the beginning of you thesis
  {Old Faithful Geyser eruption lengths, $n=272$; binned data and two
    (Gaussian) kernel density estimates ($\times 10$) with $h=h^*= .3348$
    and $h= .1$ (dotted).}% legend displayed below the graph.
