\chapter{Results and Analysis}\label{ch:results}

This chapter presents the performance of GP regression in estimating various
measures based on a simulation study.
The estimation performance of GP regression is compared with that of baseline methods.
The performance is reported for different downsampling factors, where a downsampling
factor of 2 implies that the training data contains half of the samples from the
original signal $F_X$, which has 10 samples per hour.
Additionally, results for both uniform and seasonal sampling are presented.

\section{Target Measures}

In this section, we evaluate the effectiveness of GP regression ("gp") in
estimating specific target measures. These target measures include the one-week mean,
one-day mean, one-hour mean, and time in the target range (TTR).
We compare the estimation performance of GP regression with that of several baseline methods,
including linear regression ("linear"), spline regression ("spline"), overall mean
("overall\_mean"), and naive TTR ("naive\_ttr").

\subsection{One-Week Mean}

Figure \ref{fig:weekly-mean-performance} illustrates the performance of different
methods in estimating the one-week mean under different sampling patterns.
Subfigure \ref{fig:weekly-mean-uniform-sampling-performance} and
\ref{fig:weekly-mean-seasonal-sampling-performance} display the results
for uniform and seasonal sampling, respectively. Within each subfigure, the panels
represent decreasing downsampling factors from left to right.

Performance is presented in terms of confidence or credible interval (CI) width and CI coverage.
CI width represents the width of the estimated 95\% CI for the one-week mean BP value,
measured in mmHg. CI coverage indicates the number of times the true one-week BP
values were covered by the estimated CI over 100 simulations.

Ideally, a method should achieve 95\% CI coverage with a very low CI width,
positioning itself in the upper-left corner of the plot. Achieving 95\% coverage
is considered more critical than having a low width.
Based on this 100 simulation runs, the confidence intervals
of the CI coverage values have been calculated.
Whenever these confidence intervals of the CI coverage
spans across 95\% coverage, the method is deemed adequate.

It is important to note that all plots have the same range of CI coverage values
on the y-axis, but the x-axis range of CI width values varies. As expected,
CI width values increase with larger downsampling factors and with seasonal sampling.

For the one-week mean the overall mean is equivalent to the naive TTR estimate.
Therefore, naive TTR is omitted from this analysis.
All methods perform adequately with uniform sampling.
While linear and spline regression seem to produce the smaller
confidence intervals for
the largest downsampling factor than GP regression, the three methods have
similar width as more data gets available.

In the presence of seasonal sampling, the overall mean obviously does not
provide good estimates. GP regression generally
comes closest to the target coverage, but for high downsampling factors,
linear regression remains competitive and provides even smaller CI widths.
However, the more data available the more linear regression seems to
diverge from the true BP values. This effects are more pronounced in the face
of extreme seasonal sampling. Spline regression does not cope well with seasonal
sampling it has very low CI coverage with smallest CIs across the board.

In conclusion, both linear and GP regression produce the best one-week mean estimates.
Linear regression is preferable for very high downsampling factors,
while GP regression is recommended for downsampling factors below 5,
corresponding to an average of 2 or more measurements per hour.

\subsection{One-Day and One-Hour Mean}

Figures \ref{fig:daily-mean-performance} and \ref{fig:hourly-mean-performance}
illustrate the performance of different methods in estimating the one-day and one-hour mean,
respectively, based on various downsampling patterns.

GP regression consistently produces the best estimates for both the one-hour and
one-day mean across all sampling patterns.
Its superiority becomes more pronounced with increased data availability and
an increasing amount of seasonal sampling.

Spline regression produces close to adequate results when there is uniform sampling
and high data availability.
However spline regression struggle with seasonal sampling while still
outperforming linear regression. Also, spline regression does not
only reduce CI width with more data but also
comes closer to the target coverage, whereas linear regression does even
produce worse CI coverage with more data available.

In the case of uniform sampling, the one-day mean is adequately approximated
by the naive TTR method.

In conclusion, GP regression is the only method, that can produce
adequate CIs for the expected one-day and one-hour mean BP.

\subsection{Time in Target Range}\label{subsec:time-in-target-range}

Figure \ref{fig:ttr-performance} displays the performance of different methods
in estimating TTR based on various downsampling patterns.
Among these methods, GP regression stands out as the only one consistently achieving
adequate CI coverage for most of the downsampling patterns.
While spline regression comes close to the CI coverage target
under uniform sampling and large downsampling factors it struggles again
with seasonal sampling. Linear regression on the other hand
does achieve a Ci coverage of about 70\% regardless of the sampling pattern,
again demonstrating how it is less data dependent.
The approach currently used by Aktiia for estimating TTR ("naive\_ttr")
performs poorly.
This is because it does not estimate TTR through the estimation of $f(x)$ but directly
operates on the noisy measurements $Y(x)$. As a result, it generally underestimates TTR.

\section{Examples}
This section presents illustrative examples to support the observations made in
the preceding section.


\subsection{Impact of Downsampling Factor}


Figure \ref{fig:ex-downsampling-factor} provides an example of how various
methods perform as more data is incorporated. In this context:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Linear regression demonstrates the ability to produce accurate estimates even
    at high downsampling factors. However, the linear model can only
    fit a very constrained set of function and hence
    does not exhibit substantial improvement as more data is included.
    \item Conversely, GP and spline regression displays notable improvements with an
    increasing amount of data.
    \item Spline regression struggles to capture the cyclic
    component under low data density however produces very similar results
    to GP regression at high data density.
\end{itemize}

    scenarios however the range of values shown on the y-axis varies.

\label{fig:ex-downsampling-factor}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Seasonal Samping and Downsampling Factor}




Figure \ref{fig:ex-seasonal-sampling} illustrates the influence of different
downsampling factors in the presence of extreme seasonal sampling on the estimated
BP values and CIs. In this context:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Linear regression once again demonstrates its ability to produce
    reasonably accurate results when only limited data is available.
    However, its performance does not see substantial improvement as more data is introduced.
    \item On the contrary, spline regression does not provide very accurate estimates
    at hight downsampling factors.
    Predictions tend to improve with increased data, particularly at the peaks
    where data density is higher than in the valleys.
    Notably, spline regression does not prioritize fitting a cyclic pattern,
    resulting in very inaccurate predictions with higher uncertainty
    estimates in the valleys.
    \item GP regression primarily improves by narrowing the CI width as more data is added.
    Importantly, unlike linear regression, the CIs generated by GP regression continue
    to cover the true BP values.
\end{itemize}


The example in figure \ref{fig:ex-seasonal-sampling-linear} shows
how the linear regression prediction gets worse with more data, while
GP and spline regression learn how to better predict the peaks of the cyclic pattern.

\subsection{Dominant Cyclic Component vs. Dominant AR Component}
\label{subsec:dominant-cyclic-component-vs-dominant-ar-component}

Figure \ref{fig:ex-ar-cyclic} presents a comparison of predictions under two
scenarios: when the AR component dominates and when the cyclic component takes precedence. In this context:

\begin{itemize}
    \item When the cyclic component dominates, all methods perform well and
    provide accurate predictions also for a large downsampling factor of 10.
    \item However, when the AR component is predominant:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item  Only GP regression is capable of offering reliable local BP value estimates.
        Nevertheless, in scenarios with limited data availability, GP regression tends to overemphasize the influence of
        the AR component while underestimating the contribution from the cyclic component.
        This behavior is depicted in sub-figure \ref{subfig:mean-decomposed-ar}.
        Due to the flexibility of the kernels used, they may occasionally capture features originating from another kernel.
        \item Linear regression, on the other hand, is constrained
        to predict a perfect sinusoid with a linear trend.
        Consequently, it struggles to fit the AR component effectively,
        even when data availability is high (downsampling factor of 2.5), which leads to inaccurate predictions.
        Additionally, it underestimates uncertainty in such cases.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

    When using a downsampling factor of 5, GP regression also tends to overestimate
    the variance associated with the AR component.

\subsection{Spline Regression  Failure}

Figure \ref{fig:ex-spline-failure} provides a visualization of how
spline regression generates exceptionally large CIs when
applied under high downsampling factors.
In such scenarios, bootstrapping produces highly unstable BP estimates.
This phenomenon becomes evident when observing the results of a single bootstrap
sample in these conditions, as demonstrated in subfigure \ref{subfig:ex-spline-failure-bootstrap}.
Note, that the one-week, one-day, and one-hour means derived from this single bootstrap sample
would be considerably underestimated.
However, TTR estimates might still be reasonable.

\caption[Spline Regression  Failure]{
    Spline Regression  Failure:
    Spline regression  generates extreme local BP value predictions
    under a downsampling factor of 20.
    Such BP value drops as shown in Panel (b) result in
    the generation of exceptionally
    large confidence intervals in certain regions (Panel (a)).}
