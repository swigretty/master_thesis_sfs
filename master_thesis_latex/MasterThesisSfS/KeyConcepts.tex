\chapter{Characteristics of Time Series}

A \textbf{time series} $(x_t)$ is a collection of observations $x_t$ ,
each one being recorded at a specific time $t \in T_0$.
$T_0$ is the set of times at which observations are made.
In case of discrete time series $T_0$ is a discrete set, e.g. for the equispaced case $T_0 = \{1, 2, \dots T\}$ and
for the unequally spaced case $T_0 = \{t_1, t_2, \dots t_n\}$ with $t_1 < t_2 < \dots t_n$.
For continuous time series $T_0$ is an interval, e.g. $T_0 = [1, T]$.

A \textbf{time series model} for the observed data $(x_t)$ is specified by the collection of random variables
$(X_t)$ of which $(x_t)$ is thought to be a realization.
Alternatively the time series model can also be considered a random function $f: T_0 \to \mathbb{R}$.

Throughout the thesis the term time series is used both refer to the data and the process from which it is generated.

%a specification of the joint
%distributions (or possibly only the means and covariances) of a sequence of random
%variables ${X_t}$ of which ${x_t}$ is postulated to be a realization.
