\section{Regression with Correlated Errors}
The BP time series will not be stationary but we assume it to be of the general form:

\[ Y_t= m_t + s_t + X_t \]

Where $Y_t$ is the BP time series value at time $t$, $m_t$ is a deterministic trend component,
$s_t$ a detrministice seasonal component and $\{X_t\}$ a zero mean stationary process.



Our aim is to estimate and extract the deterministic components $m_t$ and $s_t$ in the
hope that the residual $X_t$ will turn out to be a stationary time series.
We can then use the theory of such stationary time series processes to find a probabilistic model
for the process $X_t$ and to use it in conjunction with $m_t$ and $s_t$ for predcition of ${Y_t}$.


A starting point for decomposing the time series into seasonal, trend and some remainder compoenent is to use a linear
regression model of the following form

\[ Y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 * t + ) \]

seasonal trends can be modeled with a cosine curves
