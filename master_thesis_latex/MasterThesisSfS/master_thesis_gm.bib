	abstract = {In this thesis, we propose novel stationary time series models that can be used when the
observations are taken on irregularly spaced times. First, we present a model with a first-
order moving average structure, and then we generalized it to consider an autoregressive
component. We called the first model irregularly spaced first-order moving average and
the second one irregularly spaced first-order autoregressive moving average. Their defini-
tions and properties are established. We present their state-space representations and their
one-step linear predictors. The behavior of the maximum likelihood estimator is studied
through Monte Carlo experiments. Illustrations are presented with real and simulated data.

We generalize RNNs to have continuous-time hidden dynamics defined by ordinary differential equations (ODEs), a model we call ODE-RNNs. Furthermore, we use ODE-RNNs to replace the recognition network of the recently-proposed Latent ODE model. Both ODE-RNNs and Latent ODEs can naturally handle arbitrary time gaps between observations, and can explicitly model the probability of observation times using Poisson processes. We show experimentally that these ODE-based models outperform their RNN-based counterparts on irregularly-sampled data.},

	abstract = {This study introduces the method of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) for analysing univariate time series by forecasting as well as extracting trends and frequencies. The key advantage of DMD is its data-driven nature which does not rely on any prior assumptions (like Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA)) except the inherent dynamics which are captured over time. Indeed, this study will show that the DMD eigenvalues with frequencies that are closer to the origin in the complex plane capture the trends in the time series. Moreover, the temporal evolution of the DMD modes, which is preserved via the Vandermonde matrix, can be used to reconstruct the desired components and perform forecasting at the same time. The results at various noise levels on simulated data suggests that DMD is a promising approach to modelling a time series with a noisy structure. Although these properties are not new in the DMD literature, the novel contributions of this paper are in making the method of DMD work for univariate time series through a four staged pipeline. Thus, this is the first work that shows DMD can be used for modelling, predicting, and forecasting a univariate time series.},

	abstract = {In this book, Andrew Harvey sets out to provide a unified and comprehensive theory of structural time series models. Unlike the traditional ARIMA models, structural time series models consist explicitly of unobserved components, such as trends and seasonals, which have a direct interpretation. As a result the model selection methodology associated with structural models is much closer to econometric methodology. The link with econometrics is made even closer by the natural way in which the models can be extended to include explanatory variables and to cope with multivariate time series. From the technical point of view, state space models and the Kalman filter play a key role in the statistical treatment of structural time series models. The book includes a detailed treatment of the Kalman filter. This technique was originally developed in control engineering, but is becoming increasingly important in fields such as economics and operations research. This book is concerned primarily with modelling economic and social time series, and with addressing the special problems which the treatment of such series poses. The properties of the models and the methodological techniques used to select them are illustrated with various applications. These range from the modellling of trends and cycles in US macroeconomic time series to to an evaluation of the effects of seat belt legislation in the UK.},
