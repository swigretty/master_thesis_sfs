\section{Thesis Objective}\label{sec:thesis-objective}

The thesis aims at giving an overview of time series analysis methods for irregularly sampled data.

The standard time series analysis methods usually assume discrete equispaced time and introductory textbooks on
time series analysis either completely omit the irregularly spaced case or they only dedicate
a very small section to continuous time models or to state-space models
with missing observations \citeauthor{brockwell_time_1991}, \citeauthor{brockwell_introduction_2016},
\citeauthor{cryer_time_2008}, \citeauthor{chatfield_analysis_2003}.

I will thereafter present the most important concepts and what I have identified to be the basic methods for
the analysis of irregularly spaced time series.

The topic is motivated by a "real world" problem from medicine.

%Motivated by a "real world" problem from medicine, I have tried to identify the most important concepts and basic
%methods for the analysis of irregularly space time series, which I will be presented in this thesis.
The problem at hand is the one of extracting time series characteristics from a dataset
featuring blood pressure (BP) measurements sampled at irregularly spaced time points.
High BP is known to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.
A person’s BP level is generally summarized using the average BP value over available measurements within a given time range.
A novel monitoring device already allows to collect BP estimates round the clock.
The device is collecting photoplethysmography (PPG) signals and converting them into BP measurements.
Typically, the system will yield approximately 1.5 BP measurements per hour, but depending on the quality of the PPG signal and some additional external factors,
this sampling frequency can widely vary and the expected range lies roughly between 0 and 5 measurements per hour.
Having good estimates of the true BP values at any, potentially not observed, time would allow for a better estimation
of the person’s cardiovascular risk, and enable the development of novel valuable metrics.
The thesis will focus on a set of time series characteristics, which have been considered most relevant for estimating
the person’s cardiovascular risk.
The characteristics of interest are.
\begin{itemize}
    \item the mean function of the BP time series
    \item the one-week mean BP value
    \item any "long-term" trends
    \item characteristics of the circadian cycle, such as the mean day and night BP
\end{itemize}
Besides the point estimates also their CI are of interest.
Importantly, the CI should be able to capture the epistemic uncertainty, i.e. the uncertainty due to the lack of data.
This means the width of the CI intervals around the mean function will not be constant but depend on how much
data is available in the proximity of the point of prediction.
The described endpoints are all based on prediction at the not observed passed time points however not on forcasting at new time points in
the future.
Hence, the thesis will only focus on the task of reconstructing BP values between the first and last time point in the dataset.

This "real world" problem will serve as a running example throughout the Thesis.
Although the topic is motivated by a real dataset we will restrict ourselves to simulated data,
which will mimic the most important characteristics of BP time series data.
